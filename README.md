# Features

The mod is pretty simple, it automatically picks the dialogue choices for you. It follows the following rules whenever a dialog menu appears: First it plays all optional dialogues, then quest dialogues but only where there is only 1 choice available.

This means that you will only see the UI when:
- there are multiple important choices available
- when there are actions available like an haircut, a merchant, a bribe, etc...
- when there is no unread dialogue left

There are cases where you don't want the mod to play a random optional choice for you, in those cases the mod listens to two keybinds to short circuit it : UP or DOWN (W or S on keyboard), if you press any of these keys when a choice was supposed to appear where the mod would have picked for you, the mod will show the UI and let you pick.
